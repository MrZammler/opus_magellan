-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   13-Mar-96 - Initial release
      #9

      #10    - Rearranged creator GUI. There is now only one line for bytes
               with a cycle gadget to turn case sensitivity on and off.

   14-Mar-96 - Fixed bug which caused the built in command list of the
      #11      filetype editor to be corrupt and cause enforcer hits when
               calling the editor from the creator from the finder.

      #12    - Fixed bug which could create incorrect filename patterns.

      #13    - Added some logic to the creator to make better choices of
               which filetype fields to enable by default. IFF FORM will
               now override all other matches.

             - Using the case sensitivity cycle gadget could change the
               status of the checkbox.

             - The Finder listview is now read only.

      #14    - The Finder listview is now sorted accurately.
