<P>Actually, this isn't completely true: the
<CODE>struct DiskObject</CODE> really contains the new images in its
private data. The only way to retrieve it is by calling <CODE>DupDiskObject()</CODE>
and passing the tag <CODE>ICONDUPA_ActivateImageData</CODE>. This trick is used
by the Workbench as a workaround to display the new style image in
AppIcons provided by non-V44-aware applications.

<P>In fact, it is strongly discouraged because it installs
patches on the <CODE>icon.library</CODE> with no support for the new
extensions.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="V44_Changes_12.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>To prevent this from happening, you must explicitly set the
<CODE>ICONGETA_RemapIcon</CODE> tag to FALSE.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="V44_Changes_17.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>This feature obsoletes the <CODE>LoadV43Module</CODE>
command which was distributed with earlier V43 <CODE>scsi.device</CODE> and
<CODE>FastFileSystem</CODE> updates.
