<P>
The <CODE>SetPatch</CODE> program has been extended in V44 to perform
some additional functions required by OS 3.5.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

Remove ROM based libraries from Exec's library list before they
have been opened by applications, so that a disk-based replacement
can be subsequently loaded by ramlib. SetPatch defaults to remove
<CODE>icon.library</CODE> and <CODE>workbench.library</CODE> automatically. This can be
overridden with the <CODE>DISABLEROMMODULES</CODE> command line parameter.
This feature obsoletes the <CODE>RemLibrary</CODE> command which was used
in earlier OS 3.5 beta releases.

<LI>

Load resident modules from <TT>`Devs:Amiga ROM Update'</TT> and add them
to Exec's residents list<A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="V44_Changes_foot.html#FOOT4">(4)</A>. The updated versions will then be
initialized by Exec at bootstrap time. <CODE>SetPatch</CODE> uses this
feature to replace the ROM versions of the <CODE>scsi.device</CODE> and
the <CODE>FastFileSystem</CODE> with the updated V44 versions. <CODE>SetPatch</CODE>
determines which modules need to be replaced automatically, but this can
also be overridden by the command line parameters.

</UL>

<P>
The V44 <CODE>SetPatch</CODE> command is designed to work with any Kickstart since
V37, altrough it has been tested extensively only on V40. <STRONG>NOTE WELL:</STRONG>
The replacement modules included in <TT>`Amiga ROM Update'</TT> are to be used on
Kickstart V40 <STRONG>ONLY</STRONG> so they won't work with earlier Kickstart versions.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`CheckSetPatch.c'</TT> code fragment included in the NDK may help
some software developers to internally turn off workarounds for OS bugs
conditionally.

 [TODO: describe command line template]
