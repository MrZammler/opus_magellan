<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="V44_Changes_toc.html#TOC7">Adding drop zones</A></H3>

<P>
Once it is created, Workbench will allow the user to drop an
icon anywhere inside an <CODE>AppWindow</CODE>, regardless of whether the
icon was dropped on an area designated for dropping icons on
or not. With <CODE>AddAppWindowDropZoneA()</CODE> you can tell Workbench
which <CODE>AppWindow</CODE> areas are suitable for dropping icons on.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="V44_Changes_toc.html#TOC8">Drop zone <CODE>AppMessage</CODE>s</A></H3>

<P>
Once an <CODE>AppWindow</CODE> has a drop zone installed, Workbench will send
a new type of <CODE>AppMessage</CODE> to your port if icons are dropped on
a drop zone. Instead of <CODE>AMTYPE_APPWINDOW</CODE> type messages you
will receive <CODE>AMTYPE_APPWINDOWZONE</CODE> messages. In fact, you will
no longer hear any <CODE>AMTYPE_APPWINDOW</CODE> type messages since
Workbench will allow users to drop icons only on drop zones.
Be prepared to handle this.

</P>
<P>
Adding a drop zone to an AppWindow does not guarantee that only
<CODE>AMTYPE_APPWINDOWZONE</CODE> type messages will arrive at your message
port. In fact, the user may be able to drop an icon on the window
before the first drop zone is installed. Be prepared to handle
this.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="V44_Changes_toc.html#TOC9">Drop zones priority</A></H3>

<P>
Workbench checks drop zones in the order in which they were added
to the <CODE>AppWindow</CODE>. Thus, if two zones overlap, the zone that was
added first will be reported as hit.

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>AppWindow</CODE> starts out with its entire area available for
dropping icons on. Thus, you may receive <CODE>AppMessage</CODE>s for icons
dropped upon your <CODE>AppWindow</CODE> before you have added the first
drop zone to it. Be prepared to handle this.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="V44_Changes_toc.html#TOC10">Drop zone hooks</A></H3>

<P>
Using the <CODE>WBDZA_Hook</CODE> tag, you can set a hook that will be
invoked whenever the mouse enters or leaves your drop zone
area. Your hook will be called with the following parameters:

</P>

<PRE>

result = hookFunc(hook,reserved,arm)
  D0               A0     A2     A1

LONG hookFunc(struct Hook *hook, APTR reserved,
              struct AppWindowDropZoneMsg *adzm);

struct AppWindowDropZoneMsg
{
    struct RastPort * adzm_RastPort;    /* RastPort to render into. */
    struct IBox       adzm_DropZoneBox; /* Limit your rendering to this area. */
    ULONG             adzm_ID;          /* \ These come from straight */
    ULONG             adzm_UserData;    /* / from AddAppWindowDropZoneA(). */
    LONG              adzm_Action;      /* See below for a list of actions. */
};

#define ADZMACTION_Enter (0)
#define ADZMACTION_Leave (1)

</PRE>

<P>
The <CITE>reserved</CITE> parameter will be set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
For future enhancement, make sure that your hook function
always returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The drop zone message contents are as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>adzm_RastPort</CODE>
<DD>
A pointer to the <CODE>RastPort</CODE> to render into. Typically, this
is the <CODE>RastPort</CODE> of the window the drop zone is attached to.

<DT><CODE>adzm_DropZoneBox</CODE>
<DD>
This member describes the position and size of the drop zone.
The zone is guaranteed to be a valid area, i.e. the Width and Height
will both be greater than 0 and the Left/Top will be well within the
bounds of the window containing the drop zone.

<DT><CODE>adzm_ID</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>adzm_UserData</CODE>
<DD>
These two come straight from the values you passed as the <CITE>id</CITE>
and <CITE>userData</CITE> parameters to <CODE>AddAppWindowDropZoneA()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>adzm_Action</CODE>
<DD>
Depending upon whether the mouse has just entered or left the drop
zone area, this variable will be set to <CODE>ADZMACTION_Enter</CODE> or to
<CODE>ADZMACTION_Leave</CODE>. Any other values for <CODE>adzm_Action</CODE>
should be ignored.

</DL>

<P>
When the mouse enters the drop zone, do your drop zone area
highlighting. When the mouse leaves the drop zone, remove any
highlighting done in the previous <CODE>ADZMACTION_Enter</CODE> pass.

</P>
<P>
Note that the mouse leaving your drop zone box does not imply that
no icons will be dropped on it. You may still receive a notification
lateron, telling you that your drop zone had icons dropped on it.
The hook function is solely for highlighting and unhighlighting the
drop zone area.

</P>
<P>
A final word of warning: when your hook code is called, you must limit
your rendering to simple drawing operations from <CODE>graphics.library</CODE>;
if you do anything complex that involves Intuition locking and unlocking
the display, such as refreshing gadgets or locking <CODE>IntuitionBase</CODE>,
you will deadlock the operating system. You have been warned!

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="V44_Changes_toc.html#TOC11">Removing drop zones</A></H3>

<P>
Use <CODE>RemoveAppWindowDropZone()</CODE> to remove a drop zone previously
added with <CODE>AddAppWindowDropZone()</CODE>. Due to the asynchronous
nature of Workbench/user interaction, you may receive <CODE>AppIcon</CODE>
drop zone messages for zones that you have just removed. These messages
may arrive in the time between your code calling <CODE>RemoveAppWindowDropZone()</CODE>
and Workbench responding to the drop zone removal request. Be prepared to
handle this. Once a drop zone is removed, it will generate no
new <CODE>AppMessage</CODE>s.

</P>
<P>
Before the <CODE>AppWindow</CODE> is removed, all its drop zones will be removed
first. There is no need for you to call <CODE>RemoveAppWindowDropZone()</CODE>
for every single one.

</P>
