<P>
The <CODE>icon.library</CODE> has been enhanced to support palette mapped
icons. The icon file format has been extended in a backwards
compatible way to support palette mapped images as well as
old-style images. This means that V44 icons can contain TWO
image sets: the old-style planar images (for normal and
selected states) and the new style palette mapped images.

</P>
<P>
New API calls are provided to retrieve the V44 image data.
The <CODE>GetDiskObject()</CODE> and <CODE>GetDiskObjectNew()</CODE> calls are now
declared obsolete: they are still supported only for backwards
compatiblity, therefore they don't provide a way to access the new
palette mapped images<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="V44_Changes_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>.

</P>
<P>
Applications which manipulate icons should be adapted to use
the new <CODE>GetIconTagList()</CODE>. This new function is a superset of
<CODE>GetDiskObject()</CODE>: it still returns a pointer to a pointer
to a <CODE>struct DiskObject</CODE>, but it provides greater control
by means of several taglist parameters.

</P>
<P>
The defaults are to load and automatically remap the new
style images embedded into the icon. The <CODE>ICONGETA_Screen</CODE>
tag specifies which Screen the icon is to be displayed on.
See the <CODE>GetIconTagList()</CODE> AutoDoc for more information.

</P>
<P>
The new <CODE>icon.library/IconControlA()</CODE> call allows the
applications to retrieve and change any of the extended icon
attributes including the palette and the imagery.
