This is a replacement diskinfo.module for Directory Opus 5.5. It replaces
the old text-based interface with a new graphical representation of
free space. You can also relabel the disk from the requester.

To install, simply copy the diskinfo.module file to your dopus5:modules
directory. You might want to shift the old diskinfo.module file into your
dopus5:modules/storage directory in case you want to go back to the old
one. You may need to reboot after copying the new module.

If you are using a non-English language catalog file, you will also need
to remove or replace the old diskinfo.catalog.
