To these people, and any others who I have forgotten (I'm sure there are many),
my sincere thanks. To all the beta testers (some are named above), Greg and I
appreciate all the hard work you've done, and for putting up with the abuse :)

To Greg and Bron, thank you very much for putting up with me in Brisbane for
six months. I had a great time, and I'll always remember it.

To everyone who was Inovatronics, it couldn't have come this far without you.
I wish you the best of luck in whatever you do - no hard feelings.

A special thank you to Josh, Mike, Tania and Andrew, for helping keep me sane.
Tania, I might not have been much of a friend over the past couple of years,
thank you for still talking to me.

Hello to Trystan and Barb!

This is possibly the last major Amiga program you will see from me. I've been
sitting behind a monitor almost solidly for over seven years now, and I think
it's time to do something different. Computers get to be so impersonal after
a while. I would like to wish Amiga Technologies the best of luck in bringing
the Amiga back. In a gray world of PC clones, it's nice to see something
different every once in a while.

Thanks to everyone who has bought and supported Opus. To those people who
haven't paid for it, think how you'd feel about sitting behind a computer for
five years.

To everyone - live long and prosper!
