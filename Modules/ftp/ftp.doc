New ftp module features:

	  .35	'Copy/Also Copy Source's xxx' and 'Copy/Set Source Archive
			Bit' would use the local Opus settings if the source
			lister was a local one.  Now the ftp settings are
			always used.  For site-site copy, the source is used.

		When the above options were enabled, the resulting file
			would have the correct protection bits, date,
			and comment; but the lister didn't always reflect
			this.  When uploading files with 'Also Copy Source's
			Datestamp/Protection Bits' turned off, these fields
			are only approximated to save unnecessary network
			overhead.  You can always rescan the destination
			afterward if these fields are important.

		Site-site copy would always report file size as 0.  This is
			now fixed.  If you abort a transfer the resulting
			size is not actually known without a rescan so the
			size will be shown as 1/2 the total size.

	  .36	With 'Copy/Set Source Archive Bit' enabled, the source lister
			was being updated for downloads even though this options
			is only possible for uploads.

		Added 'Copy/Rescan Destination' option.  This causes the
			ftp lister to be rescanned automatically after each
			upload or site to site transfer.  This ensures all
			protection bits, dates, and sizes are accurate but
			is not a good idea for slow ftp sites.

	  .37	The 'passive' option was broken.  Not any more.

	  .38	Implemented support for servers with broken ls command
			that breaks when a dirname contains spaces.
			Set Env:DOpus/ftp_broken_list for now

	  .39	The above mentioned broken servers are now also supported
	  		for the remaining recursive operations of
	  		Delete, Protect, GetSizes, and FindFile.

	  .40	Fixed small problem with FTPOoptions description

	  .41	Added environment variable "DOpus/ftp_fred_hack" which
	  		allows OpusFTP to work with filenames which begin
	  		with spaces.  Note that there is potential for
	  		this to cause some servers to break.

			Aborted transfers now have a comment set indicating
			that they have been aborted and what their full size is.

			Colon ":" characters are now filtered to underscores "_".
